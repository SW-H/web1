    HyperText Makeup Language

    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language[1]
    for creating a webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser.
    <br>They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video.<br>
    HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web
    browser can display them correctly.</p> <p>HTML can also be used to add meta information
    to a webpage. Meta information is usually <br>
    not shown by web browsers and is data about the web page, e.g.,
    the name of the person who created the page.
    <br>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style HTML elements while
    JavaScript is used to manipulate HTML elements and CSS styles.</p>

    <br><br>HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are several versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of HTML is dubbed HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.
